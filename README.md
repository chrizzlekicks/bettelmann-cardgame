# bettelmann-cardgame

### Description
Bettelmann ("Beggar Man") or Tod und Leben ("Life and Death") is a simple, trick-taking card game for 2 players that is suitable for children. Bettelmann is of German origin and is mentioned as early as 1841. It closely resembles Battle. 
Both players are given 16 cards, unseen, which they place face down in front of them. Non-dealer plays his top card to the table, face up. Dealer then plays his top card. Cards rank in their natural order and the trick is taken by the highest ranking card, regardless of suit. The trick winner adds the trick to the bottom of his pile. If the two cards are the same rank, they remain in place and are captured by the winner of the next trick (Pierer) or the player who played the first card wins (Gööck, Müller). The latter suggests that the trick winner leads to the next trick although this is nowhere stated by either source. The first player to run out of cards is the Beggar (Bettelmann) and loses the game.
